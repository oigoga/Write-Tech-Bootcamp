## Introduction
Twitter (now called X) is a popular social media platform known for its real-time, short-form communication. Users can post 280-character messages called "tweets" to share thoughts, news, and updates with their followers and the general public. Twitter's distinct features include hashtags, retweets, and likes, making it a dynamic and engaging platform for individuals, businesses, and organizations.

When it comes to breaking news, viral trends, and international conversations, Twitter is essential. It's a platform where users may communicate with others around the globe, keep up with current events, and voice their opinions on a range of subjects. Twitter is a popular platform for public leaders, celebrities, and corporations to communicate with their audience.

This tutorial aims to help new users get started on Twitter, navigate the platform effectively, and understand its key features. By the end of this guide, you'll be well-equipped to tweet, interact with others, and make the most of your Twitter experience.

## Setting Up Your Twitter Account

Twitter account creation is the first step towards joining the Twitterverse (probably just me calling it this). Here's how to do it:

1. The first step is to go to the website [twitter.com](https://twitter.com). There will be an option to either sign up with your Google account or Apple account and another to manually create an account. This is discretionary. Whichever you choose will work. (Note that using an Apple account is only for those with Apple IDs and likewise Google.)

2. Follow the prompts which will be relatively straightforward and fill in your details:
   - Your name
   - Email or Phone
   - Date of Birth

3. You then agree to their terms of service and click "Sign Up."

4. After the form has been accurately filled, a mail will be sent to you to verify your email. If you use your phone number, a text with a code will be sent to the phone number.

5. Fill in the corresponding input field with the verification code and click the 'Next' button.

6. The next step would be to create a password. This should be a very strong password. Click the "Next" button.

7. The option to upload a profile picture will be given to you. Your profile picture is your visual representation on Twitter. Have a favorite selfie? You could use it here. It's essential to choose a clear and recognizable photo, such as a headshot or a logo, as this is what people will see next to your tweets. Twitter recommends using an image that is at least 400x400 pixels for optimal display. Your profile picture can be changed later if needed.

8. Create your username, also known as your handle. This is your unique identifier on Twitter. It's what people will use to mention or tag you in tweets.

The following steps are not compulsory but are necessary to give your profile a finished look:

9. Add your bio. This is a brief description of yourself or your purpose on Twitter. You have 160 characters to convey your personality, interests, or what you do. Craft a concise and engaging bio that provides insight into what others can expect from your tweets.

10. Customize your header photo. The header photo is a banner that is usually displayed behind the profile picture and this gives the reader a little more insight into your personality or brand.

11. Finally, you have the option to share more about yourself in the "Personal Information" section, which includes your location, website link, and date of birth. Sharing your location can help you connect with people nearby who share your interests.

After all these, your Twitter account is set up, and you will have created an inviting and authentic Twitter presence that can attract like-minded users and encourage engagement with your tweets. It is important to note that your information can be edited.
After completing these steps, your Twitter account is set up and ready for use.

## Navigating the Twitter Interface
Twitter’s interface may seem overwhelming at first, but it's easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. Let's explore the homepage, sidebar, and toolbar.

### Exploring the Homepage
The feed displays tweets from accounts you follow and related accounts. You'll also see recommended tweets and threads (long-form text posts).

## The Sidebar
The sidebar contains details about your profile. From top to bottom, you can see:

- Your profile picture
- Your username and display name
- The number of your followers and those you are following

Under these, there are the following buttons:

- **Profile button:** This button allows you to access your own profile, where you can view your tweets, media, followers, following, and other information. You can also edit your profile, including your profile picture, bio, and header photo from this section.

- **Premium button:** This button leads to the subscription service - Twitter Blue. Twitter Blue provides premium features to subscribers, including ad-free browsing, enhanced bookmarking, and customizable app icons. Clicking this button typically takes you to the subscription or premium features page, where you can learn more and sign up for it. It also comes with some perks, such as the ability to earn from tweets with a large number of impressions.

- **Bookmarks button:** This button allows you to access your saved tweets. When you come across a tweet you want to save and revisit later, you can click the bookmark icon on that tweet, and it will be added to your bookmarks. Clicking this button will take you to your collection of saved tweets, making it easy to organize and reference content you've found interesting.

- **Lists:** Lists are a way to organize Twitter accounts you follow into categories or groups. These can be personal lists or public lists that others can subscribe to. The Lists button typically allows you to access, manage, and create lists. You can add or remove accounts from lists and view tweets from accounts within a specific list.

- **Spaces:** Spaces is a feature on Twitter that allows users to host and join audio conversations. These are real-time audio chat rooms where you can discuss various topics with other users. The Spaces button will lead you to a section where you can discover and join ongoing audio conversations or create your own Space if you have that feature enabled on your account.

- **Monetization button:** This button may refer to features related to earning money on Twitter, such as through the Twitter Partner Program or Super Follows. It would typically take you to a section where you can explore options for monetizing your Twitter presence, including enabling features that allow your audience to support your content financially.


### The Toolbar
- The toolbar is like the major navigation of Twitter and it has 5 buttons.
  - The home page, which is the default display of Twitter.
  - The "Explore" tab (represented by a magnifying glass icon) takes you to a section where you can discover trending news, stories, and content tailored to your interests.
